To ease your review time I collected and organised the most recent experience and repositories I created over the past 12 months in this repo.



##### What you will find here:

- [Bootcamp Project 1](): this single-player game is the first web app I ever built. I used `p5JS` and `DOM manipulation`

- [Bootcamp Project 2](): to build this web app I learned to `work with a partner` for the first time, `NodeJS, ExpressJS, MongoDB, Mongoose` and `Handlebars`

- [Bootcamp Project 3](): full-stack web app with CRUD functionalities using `ReactJS, MongoDB, NodeJS` developed in a 3 people group

- [Bootcamp Labs](): here are all the exercises I did during the Web Dev program to learn `pair programming, JavaScript, ReactJS, NodeJS, ExpressJS, MongoDB` and `p5JS`

- [Code Challenges](): short `JavaScript` coding exercises to improve my programming skills

- [Swift CV](): my CV in an interactive iOS app to learn `Swift UI`

## Ironhack Labs



This section is a collection of the exercises I did during my 9-week bootcamp program at Ironhack in Q1 2021

They were originally developed in their own dedicated repos during the bootcamp but -for the sake of interview reviews- I moved them all here ðŸ§¹

It was good fun to learn how to move git repos including all branches and commit history
